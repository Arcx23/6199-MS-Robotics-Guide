# About forking

A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.

You can contribute by submitting pull requests from your fork to the upstream repository. For more information, see [Fork a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).

# Forking a repository

3. By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. Optionally, in the "Repository name" field, type a name.
4. Keep every other value the same.
5. Click Create fork.

# Editing or Adding Files
> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is somewhat difficult to edit file paths and names on GitHub web. To counteract this click the **<> Code** button and then **Open with GitHub Desktop** (This will require downloading the app)
