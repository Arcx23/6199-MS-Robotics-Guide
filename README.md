# MS-Robotics-Guide
## Building Resources (Brayden & Enpeng):
We have put together this guide to assist with designing or building simple and more complex mechanisms that are useful in most builds. This guide was designed with the intent of detailing simple systems and also offering a brief overview of more complex systems, and potential uses on your robots. 
### NOTE: this is not a definitive list and you will still have to design your own systems
If you have any questions/further issues: You can contact one of us Enpeng Jiang Brayden Watt at any time with an image and explanation of the problem. Make sure your email is well thought out, and address a specific issue. We are here to help with problems, not build the robot. (Please email both of us for the best chance of quick response)
