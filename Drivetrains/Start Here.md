# Drivetrains: A Must Build - see Troubleshooting for issues
## Basic CAD Steps,Building Steps
Steps to  build a good drivetrain (If you follow all these steps you should have a solid drivetrain): each step is linked to a more detailed section on the topic.
State your intentions (what do you need to do for this years game)
Your team should plan what the goal of the robot is and how the design should complement and make the goal possible. Think about supports (which type, layout (top/bottom), parts/components), motors (green/blue), gear ratios (gear down/gear up)
If you don’t know how to do this. Read the detailed overview of drivetrains. Overview
## Plan in CAD or use a very detailed drawing
This drawing/CAD should be accessible to your whole team. All members have to understand the idea and how to build it. This design should not just be a size marker, it should contain where the wheels, motors, and gears go. It should detail where structure goes and how metals are going to be joined and how to properly support the drivetrain to not tilt. CADing screw by screw, while tedious, will eradicate 90%+ of issues that could appear in the future. Although you can cad in less detail (no connectors, screws, joints, etc) it will only serve as a “blueprint” or 3d plan for the robot.
