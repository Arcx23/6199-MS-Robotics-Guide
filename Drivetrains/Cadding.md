- This is a very important step as enpeng couldn't do this.
- I also dont know how you do this
### 2. Plan your wheel, motor, and gear layout
- Using real C-channels, axles, gears, etc, play around with the axles insert into the channel, where gears connect, and how much space is needed between axles, and wheels.
### 3. Inserting Pieces
- Start by going to the assemblies tab at the bottom of your document
