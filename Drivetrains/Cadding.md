### 1. Log in to CAD software
> [!TIP]
> Use westminster.onshape.com
- This is a very important step as enpeng couldn't do this.
- I also dont know how you do this
### 2. Plan your wheel, motor, and gear layout
- Using real C-channels, axles, gears, etc, play around with the axles insert into the channel, where gears connect, and how much space is needed between axles, and wheels.
### 3. Inserting Pieces
- Start by going to the assemblies tab at the bottom of your document

- Click on the insert button.

- Navigate to other documents then click on what you named enpengâ€™s library 
- <img width="598" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-24 at 4 00 17 PM" src="https://github.com/Arcx23/MS-Robotics-Guide/assets/132633896/d953171f-56ce-4138-9ef6-fd68093f4aa3">
- Search for the part you want to insert. In this case I am inserting a C-channel
- <img width="598" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-24 at 4 00 33 PM" src="https://github.com/Arcx23/MS-Robotics-Guide/assets/132633896/97666645-2391-4d38-8e45-d0379fc89314">
- Click on the part that appears from the search result
- <img width="598" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-24 at 4 00 45 PM" src="https://github.com/Arcx23/MS-Robotics-Guide/assets/132633896/4fe04be2-f1ba-4a2a-b270-618c70846d4a">
- Press the green check mark
- <img width="598" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-24 at 4 01 01 PM" src="https://github.com/Arcx23/MS-Robotics-Guide/assets/132633896/8fa45a06-a5b0-4530-a34f-3a16c4f1d712">
- Done!!
### 4. Rotating and Transforming Pieces
- Click on the part you want to move. (Note: grouped or fastned parts move together.)
- <img width="598" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-24 at 4 02 20 PM" src="https://github.com/Arcx23/MS-Robotics-Guide/assets/132633896/03cb30d2-1d75-4e73-b7de-1ceaebc30e05">
- Select the circles with lines to rotate or arrows to move the piece.
  - Enter an angle
  - <img width="598" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-24 at 4 02 49 PM" src="https://github.com/Arcx23/MS-Robotics-Guide/assets/132633896/d9d55fbd-856c-46b2-8afd-4e3bc0932061">
  - Enter a distance
  - <img width="598" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-24 at 4 03 05 PM" src="https://github.com/Arcx23/MS-Robotics-Guide/assets/132633896/05c94ec9-fcb6-4b47-b32c-ef0cc9979aeb">
  - You can also use the squares to move the piece around freely with your cursor.

### 5. Fastening Two Pieces
- After inserting at least two pieces, select the fasten tool to fasten them.
- <img width="602" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-24 at 4 05 59 PM" src="https://github.com/Arcx23/MS-Robotics-Guide/assets/132633896/1936dfd5-db8f-4927-997e-2abb5014c893">
- Move your cursor over the piece you want to move. When the white circles appear, hold the shift key.
- <img width="602" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-24 at 4 06 12 PM" src="https://github.com/Arcx23/MS-Robotics-Guide/assets/132633896/9d6f6612-6a6c-411f-9766-61fd4be2e1b6">
- Select the circle on the point you want to move. (This point will be what fastens (moves to) to your other fasten point)
- <img width="602" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-24 at 4 06 42 PM" src="https://github.com/Arcx23/MS-Robotics-Guide/assets/132633896/32ad7442-14df-45df-aeac-658658e5c439">
- Move your cursor over the piece you want the part to move to. Again hold shift and select a point.
- <img width="602" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-24 at 4 07 00 PM" src="https://github.com/Arcx23/MS-Robotics-Guide/assets/132633896/b14a9266-461d-4e7a-881b-82b525a0dd49">
- Now that the part has moved (hopefully) a menu will appear with options. The most important tool in this menu is the Flip Primary Axis tool. Use this tool if the part is facing the wrong direction.
